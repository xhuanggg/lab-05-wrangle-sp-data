```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(dsbox) 
```

```{r load-data, message = FALSE}
states <- read_csv("data/states.csv")
data(dennys, package = "dsbox")
data(laquinta, package = "dsbox")
```

### Exercise 1

There are three Denny's and two La Quinta in Alaska.
```{r Ex1}
dn_ak <- dennys %>%
  filter(state == "AK")
nrow(dn_ak)

lq_ak <- laquinta %>%
  filter(state == "AK")
nrow(lq_ak)
```

### Exercise 2

There are three Denny's and two La Quinta in Alaska. Each Denny's corresponds to two La Quinta. Therefore, there should be $$3\times2=6$$ pairs.
